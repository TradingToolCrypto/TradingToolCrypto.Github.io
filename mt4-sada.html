							<h2>MetaTrader 4</h2>
							<p>The SADA Robot is the only MetaTrader 4 product that TradingToolCrypto offers because there is one thing that MT4 does so well, we haven't needed MT5. SADA stands for Semi-Automated DAX Algorithm and it's a High Frequency intraday trading system optimized for the <strong>GE30.Cash DAX Indices instrument</strong>. We only run this algorithm on one particular brokerage (RoboForex) since they offer an exclusive commission discounts and fixed 0.50 USD spreads which can't be beat by any other Forex Brokerage. With these special trading conditions, we had in mind High Frequency Trading that could extract profits through out the trading hours of the German Stock Exchange session.</p>
							<p>SADA is packed with <strong>four different trading strategies</strong> with a complete User Interface to adjust all the parameters. We went the extra mile to integrate telegram messenger app to allow adjustments on the fly. This is the perfect solution for anyone on the go. The Telegram extension to the SADA Robot is actually more powerful than the built-in user interface by extensioning more functionality, commands, and market updates with recommended settings on a daily basis.</p>

								<p>Different strategies prevent alpha decay by avoiding the pitfalls of most automated trading systems that repeat a pattern over and over again. Since the markets are constantly evolving, the strategies we select for the current environment shouldn't be based on a historical backtest with optimized settings. The parameters within the strategies can be easily adjusted through the <strong>user-interface or telegram</strong> to prevent over-fitting or over optimization that plague most robots on the market. </p>

								<p>When you are looking for a robot to trade with your own money, you want <strong>full control</strong> over what the robot is doing. It shouldn't be a blackbox where you don't understand the logic or the input parameters that the robot needs to run.  The SADA robot is quite the opposite in this natural by giving the user full control over everything that the robot does. You  tell the robot what to do and the robot obeys. No Artificial intelligence or buzz words found here. The SADA Robot is straight forward and easy to use on day one.</p>

								<!-- Select your Strategy and direction -->
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>Once you select your strategy, you need to decide if you want to be buying, selling, or both. The advantages of being directional or one sided is that you can follow the market when it is trending or when you are expecting a breakout.  By trading in both directions, you can take advantage of the sideways movements while the market establishes its directional sentiment. </p>
								<blockquote>The market open and close are normally volative but lack directional move. Once the volatility slows down, an intraday trend can be established</blockquote>
								
								<!-- Renko Charting -->
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>Renko Charts are a great way to filter out the noise , low volatility, and the side ways market chop that can trigger your emotions, indicators, and patience. Since renko charts can filter out negligible price movements, spotting a trending market becomes more natural than traditional charts. Renko charts also have a technical advantage that can be explioted during volatility with higher precision than any other chart. SADA Robot takes advantage of everything that a renko chart can offer.  </p>
								<blockquote>Brick Size 10 for Intraday Buy and Sell Scalping and Brick Size 100 with directional Position Building</blockquote>
								
								<!-- User Interface  -->
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>One of the disadvantages with MetaTrader robots are the input parameters. The robot would normally need to be re-initized every time you need to make a small adjustment. Well, not any more with our Built-In User Interface. Now you can change any input parameter easily and instantly while keeping your robot running full speed ahead. All input parameters can also be adjusted through telegram.</p>
								<blockquote>Switch strategies, change input parameters, and run commands instantly with a click of a button</blockquote>
								<!-- Telegram Integration  -->
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>Telegram messenger app has been a major game changer for our everyday lives. Not only is it one of the simpliest and cleanest UI for a messaging app, it has a ton of goodies for developers such as the telegram bots. Telegram bots is an easy way to communicate with software in a private two way communication channel.  Secured over HTTPS and your access token, you can rest assure your data is confidential and only for your eyes. The telegram integration with the SADA robot takes trading to the next level by giving you full control over the robot remotely. For starters, all features located on the chart user interface are available through telegram. Telegram integration also comes with some advanced features only available within the messenger app. </p>
								<blockquote>Control everything on the go</blockquote>
